# EVS Frontend AutoStructure Report v1.0.0

**Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Agent:** FRONTEND_AUTOSTRUCTURE_V1.0.0  
**Project:** EVS Next.js Basic Web - Frontend  
**Version:** 1.0.0

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully created a production-ready, minimal landing page using Next.js 15 with App Router, TypeScript strict mode, and Tailwind CSS 4. The project follows modern best practices and is ready for deployment to Vercel or similar platforms.

---

## Project Structure Decision

After analyzing best practices for Next.js App Router, I chose a **flat structure** for the landing page:

```
frontend/
├── app/
│   ├── layout.tsx          # Root layout with metadata
│   ├── page.tsx            # Main landing page
│   ├── globals.css         # Global styles with Tailwind
│   ├── sitemap.ts          # Dynamic sitemap generation
│   └── opengraph-image.tsx # Dynamic OG image
├── components/
│   ├── Header.tsx          # Navigation header
│   ├── Hero.tsx            # Hero section
│   ├── About.tsx           # About section
│   ├── Features.tsx        # Features section
│   ├── Contact.tsx         # Contact form
│   └── Footer.tsx          # Footer with legal links
├── public/
│   └── robots.txt          # SEO robots configuration
├── docs/
│   ├── CHANGELOG.md        # Version history
│   └── agent_logs/         # Agent execution logs
├── LICENSE                 # EVS Custom License v1.0
└── Configuration files
```

### Structure Rationale

1. **No Route Groups**: Since this is a single-page application, route groups like `(marketing)` would add unnecessary complexity
2. **Component Organization**: Separate components folder for better maintainability and reusability
3. **Flat App Structure**: Keeps the routing simple and clear for a landing page
4. **SEO at App Level**: Metadata, sitemap, and OG image generation at the app root for optimal SEO

```

- `strict: true`
- `noEmit: true`
- `esModuleInterop: true`
- Path aliases configured for clean imports

### 6. Development Tools

## Backend Folder

The `backend` folder exists in the repository root but is **empty and ignored** as per project requirements. This project is frontend-only with no backend integration needed.
